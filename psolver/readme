Please write a program (named psolver) in a general-purpose
programming language (e.g., java, c/c++, javascript) or a scripting
language (e.g., python, perl) to solve this problem and send me the
solution.
 
Suppose you are given the following:
1) c integers d, eg, ten 8's (c=10, d=8)
2) the four basic operations: +,-,*,/
3) the parentheses: (,)
 
You can put the parentheses and the operations between integers to
produce many expressions. Among these expressions, we will care about
the ones that produce positive integers (though you need to use
floating point during computation).
 
The question is to write a program that will print out the smallest
positive integer that *cannot* be expressed using exactly the given
number of integers.
 
For example, you cannot produce a 2 using two 8's. That is, the
program should return 2 if the input is two 8's. the exact output
should look like "2 cannot be computed in 2 8s" without the quotes in
a separate line.
 
Using psolver on ten 8's as an example, I'll run your program as
 
> psolver –c 10 –d 8 [-t target]
where <target> is optional; if given, psolver shows the exact
expression to compute the positive integer <target> using the given
number of integers.
 
Here are outputs from my own code. your output should be *exactly* the
same:
 
> psolver –c 4 –d 8
5 cannot be computed in 4 8s
 
> psolver –c 4 –d 8 –t 3
3 can be computed in 4 8s
here is how: float((8+8)+8)/8 = 3
 
Your program should solve the problem correctly and according to the
requirements above. It should also be fast so that when I run it using
the following loops (count from 1 to 10, digit from 2 to 9), it should
take a few seconds. I will also try your program for a few random
targets to test the -t option.
 
bash:
for c in {1..10}; do for d in {2..9}; do $1 $2 $3 -c $c -d $d; done;
done;
 
As a hint, your program should be producing the following results for
c=4 when I run your program using this script above:
7 cannot be computed in 4 2s
11 cannot be computed in 4 3s
10 cannot be computed in 4 4s
8 cannot be computed in 4 5s
9 cannot be computed in 4 6s
4 cannot be computed in 4 7s
5 cannot be computed in 4 8s
4 cannot be computed in 4 9s
